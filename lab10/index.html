<h1>Lab 10</h1>
		<h2>ğŸ˜©ChallengesğŸ˜“</h2>
			<p>This lab went really smooth, shout out to the person in section who guided us through it ğŸ’—. Both me and my partner had one issue in our codes that caused us to struggle for a moment, but they ended up being simple errors that we over looked.</p>
		<h3>ğŸ˜£ProblemsğŸ˜–<h3>
			<p>Besides having to find our minor errors, can't say we really ran into any problems this week regarding this lab. My issue was literally that i wrote inneter instead of inner, oopsie. and my console didn't even tell me that error >:(, it's okay though figured it out.</p>
