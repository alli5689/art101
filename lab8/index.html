		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>Well we thought we needed to make the script show up on the website again, but we realized we don't so not too many challenges this time, went pretty smooth.</p>
		<h2>Problems<h2>
			<p>So i'm gonna update this as I go and currently my problem appears to be that isEven is not making sense to the javascript file.
			Status Update- fixed it, needed a comma but I used a parenthases. Still doesn't show the info on my page but it does show up in the console.
			Update- we realized we type our results and we just need it to show up in the console.</p>
