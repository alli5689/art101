       <h1>Challenges</h1>
          <p>Messing around with making new folders is kind of a challenge. I don't know though I had a midterm today and I'm super sleepy, so everything feels like a challenge. I will not be seeing you in-person class tomorrow sorry I physically can't be awake at 6:15 to make it to class, I'll toon in on zoom from bed.</p>
       <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>Now i'm struggling to add css to this new folder, not exactly sure how to do that now. Also I'm so super sleepy and If i'm being honest I can't use my brain anymore but we out her :p</p>
       <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>Well I can't get css to connect and also my script won't work so if I were gonna guess, my results arn't looking so hot for this assignment. Update: I got css to work. Now I figured out how to check for errors, and for some reason it says that my files don't exist so I don't really know what to do about that because they definatly do so check ur email cause I'm gonna ask you.</p>
