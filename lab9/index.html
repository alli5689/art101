		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>I think this is more fun when I update as I go. Currently I got all my script in javascript, but per usj (usual) my script is not showing up on my website :(.</p>
		<h2>Problems<h2>
			<p>Script won't show up, I don't know why I have this issue every damn time. I did check the console and it says it doesn't recognize new1ElElement, and it is undefined so I'll try and fix that. Like it says the issue is where I'm defining it so how is it not defined??</p>
			<p>Update: something showed up in my console but I think it's inncorrect.</p>
			<p>Update:it works</p>
		<h3>Results<h3>
			<p>Currently, I have results in my console, I'm unsure though if I did it the right way though.</p>
			<p>Update: Angela got the same results so I think we did it right. We changed some things in CSS. I made mine black and red in the spooky spirit of halloween.</p>
