	<p>Challenges</p>
		<p>For this week we mainly struggled knowing exactly how to start this lab. I realize now it's partially because we didn't finish going over the content in class on Tuesday before our Wednesday discussion when me and my partner started this lab. This meant our main struggle this week was figuring out how to assign an object.</p>
	<p>Problems</p>
			<p>This week again the problem was with figuring out how to get the script to show up, even though we got it last week. Some of the code that was left for us in the lab was kinda unfinished so that caused some confusion.
	<p>Results</p>
			<p>Our results are good, we both got everything to work, and made our little sites all cute with the css. I added a bonus meme for you instead of another photo of my dusty car, your welcome. :P
