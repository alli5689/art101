		<h1>Alli :p</h1>
			<p>My name is Alli, i'm a fourth year buisness management economic major at UCSC. I decided to take this class because I'm considering going into marketing after gradguation and I thought that computer arts programming would be a helpful tool in my career. When i'm not at school though I have many other hobbies such as sewing, roller skating, and recently i've been learning to surf.</p>
