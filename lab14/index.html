<h1>Lab 12👅</h1>

		<h2>😩Challenges😓</h2>
			<p>The challenges with this lab was deciding which lab to fix lol. Jk it was obvious one of my labs needed a lot more help than the rest of them. Lab 7 I never got her to work but I did know that it was mainly to do with my file structure, then I had a few other small bugs.</p>

		<h3>😣Problems😖<h3>
			<p>The problem for this lab was after I had fixed my first/most obvious issue, was finding the smaller ones. That's what makes this class so difficult honestly is the small mistakes. But I was able to track them down from the error code in my console.</p>

		<h4>💗🌟Results🌟💗</h4>
			<p>My results are pretty cute, I used my OG style to make it kind of match my home page. I did fix it up though, by making sure all the words were the same size font, and no headings were left out of style. I also included the same border as my home page.</p>

		<h5>🐛Debugging🐞</h5>
		<p>The main issue with this lab was that the file structure was all wrong. When I had made the folders at first, instead of duplicating old files like I realized is how most of my peers do it, I created each new file in my laptop folders. I didn't make enough folders though, I put all of my different kinds of files in the same folder and it resulted in my output not working. I did also have an open bracket I ended up having to fix, as well as missing the js/ in my link to my js file.</p>
