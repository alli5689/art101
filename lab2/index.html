	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>The subject of this lab was learning and practicing making local file structures, as well as adding index.html files</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Honestly this lab has been very challenging for us. Mainly our issue is with our files, specifically organization I think. For instance I had to put this under the wrong file on purpose because for some reason my lab 3 file keeps popping up empty. Other than that it's been a pretty slow and complicated process but we are figuring it out.
	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>We tried our best. Angela's websites look so pretty, she worked on it all day long. Alli's is more messy and goofy but it's getting there. Just as soon as she figures out how to make the outline a sharp corner and not rounded it'll look much nicer, coming soon. </p>
