	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>The subject of this lab was learning and practicing making local file structures, as well as adding index.html files</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Honestly this lab has been very challenging for us. Mainly our issue is with our files, specifically organization I think. For instance I had to put this under the wrong file on purpose because for some reason my lab 3 file keeps popping up empty. Other than that it's been a pretty slow and complicated process but we are figuring it out.
	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>After a lot of confusion and difficulty I think it actually turned out really cute for both of us. Especially after we really got into changing the colors and the borders, they are definately amatuer but still cute. I think overall our biggest issue ended up being overthinking.</p>
